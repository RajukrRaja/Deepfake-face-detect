To use the repository effectively, you can follow this step-by-step guide that outlines how to clone, set up, and work with the repository, including pushing changes to GitHub. Here’s a comprehensive guide:

Step-by-Step Guide to Use the Repository
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open Terminal/Command Prompt:

On Windows, you can use PowerShell or Command Prompt.
On macOS or Linux, open Terminal.
Navigate to Your Desired Directory: Choose a directory where you want to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/directory
Clone the Repository: Use the following command to clone the repository (replace <repository-url> with your actual GitHub URL):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RajukrRaja/Deepfake-face-detect.git
Step 2: Navigate into the Repository
Change to the directory of the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd Deepfake-face-detect
Step 3: Set Up Git Line Endings (Optional)
Configure Git to handle line endings based on your operating system:

For Windows:

bash
Copy code
git config --global core.autocrlf true
For macOS or Linux:

bash
Copy code
git config --global core.autocrlf input
Step 4: Check Repository Structure
Explore the repository structure to understand its layout. The main components are:

backend/: Contains the backend code.
frontend/: Contains the frontend code.
model/: Contains model files.
Step 5: Install Dependencies
Navigate to Frontend Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend/swapshield
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Step 6: Run the Frontend Application
After installing the dependencies, you can start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command should open the application in your web browser.

Step 7: Make Changes and Commit
Make Changes: Edit the files as needed in your code editor.

Check Git Status:

bash
Copy code
git status
Stage Your Changes:

To stage all changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Or stage specific files:

bash
Copy code
git add src/components/Navbar.jsx src/components/Sidebar.jsx
Commit Your Changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Step 8: Push Changes to GitHub
Ensure You Are on the Correct Branch:

Check that you are on the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Pull the Latest Changes (if necessary):

If your local branch is behind the remote, pull the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Push Your Changes:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Step 9: Verify Changes on GitHub
After pushing, visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes are reflected correctly.

Step 10: Handling Issues
If you encounter any issues while pulling or pushing (e.g., conflicts), you may need to resolve them based on the messages provided by Git.
If there are merge conflicts, Git will indicate which files need to be resolved. Open those files, make the necessary changes, and then repeat the staging, committing, and pushing steps.
Step 11: Documentation and Contributing
Documentation: Check if there’s a README.md file or other documentation in the repository that provides additional details about how to use or contribute to the project.
Contributing: If you want to contribute, follow the repository's guidelines for contributing (if provided).
